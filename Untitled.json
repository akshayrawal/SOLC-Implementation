This document defines the flow of data from project upload to POST request from the engine to the backend-api for license checking.

[{"projectname" : "string",
  "project owner": "string"
}
{
  "library" : "Library Name",
  "license" : "Licence Name"
},
{
  "library" : "Library Name",
  "license" : "Licence Name"
},
{
  "library" : "Library Name",
  "license" : "Licence Name"
}]


After this post request, the license-checking module, takes the licenses & project lists and checks with database for the following in policies table in the database:
The policy table contains the policy-id, policy type:project/license/attribute, name: of project/license/attribute, action: 'deny', 'approve', 'flag'


Policy for Project and license:
    "Deny-list" : if name found in this list remove from total license list and append to deny list with reason: 'owner' chose to 'deny' 'value' as a 'policy-type' for this project

    "Flag list"  : if name found in this list, append to flag list with reason:

Policy for attribtues:
    gather the list of all licenses that still in the list and make three license_lists:

    'permission'  'condition'  'restriction'

    for each license, then for every query return from the database with attribute as the policy:


    check for attribute.action + attribute.name from the policy against license_has_attribute.value
        if deny attribute and attribute in permission or condition list: remove the associated license from the license list, update license_lists





then the collated set of permission (can), conditions(must) and restriction(cannot) for each license are calclulated and
these are packaged into the second json for displaying to the end user.
